# Advent of Code 2022

Solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/). My goal for AOC 2022 is to do as many of the exercises in Haskell as possible - I would like to learn more about the language, since I have only dabbled in it a few times. Don't expect idiomatic Haskell code here :)
